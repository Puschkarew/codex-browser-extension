# Remove generated `__pycache__` artifact from tracked changes

A generated bytecode file is currently modified in the working tree and should not be part of functional changes.

## Problem Statement

Checked-in generated artifacts create noisy diffs and can hide meaningful code changes during review.

## Findings

- Modified file in git status: `/Users/vladimirpuskarev/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Codex/Browser Extension/skills/fix-app-bugs/scripts/__pycache__/bootstrap_browser_debug.cpython-313.pyc`.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Revert generated artifact and keep source-only changes (recommended)

**Approach:** Remove `.pyc` from staged/working changes and keep only source/test/doc updates.

**Pros:**
- Cleaner review surface.
- No behavior change.

**Cons:**
- None.

**Effort:** Small

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Stop tracking `__pycache__` in repo

**Approach:** If currently tracked by design mistake, remove from git index and update ignore rules.

**Pros:**
- Prevents recurrence.

**Cons:**
- Might require broader cleanup if historical artifacts exist.

**Effort:** Small

**Risk:** Low

## Recommended Action


## Technical Details

**Affected files:**
- `/Users/vladimirpuskarev/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Codex/Browser Extension/skills/fix-app-bugs/scripts/__pycache__/bootstrap_browser_debug.cpython-313.pyc`

**Database changes:**
- No

## Resources

- `git status --short`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No generated `.pyc` artifacts remain in the review diff.
- [ ] Ignore/tracking strategy prevents accidental reintroduction.

## Work Log

### 2026-02-17 - Initial Discovery

**By:** Codex

**Actions:**
- Inspected working tree and detected modified Python bytecode artifact.

**Learnings:**
- Artifact appears generated by local test execution and is not needed for code review.

## Notes

- Low severity hygiene item.
