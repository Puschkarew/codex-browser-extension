# Interim Visual Report Template

Use this template for iterative visual-parity loops before final closure.
Keep it short and focused on deltas only.

## Hypothesis delta

- What changed since the previous iteration?
- Which hypothesis is stronger/weaker now?

## Evidence delta

- New artifact bundle path(s):
  - `runtime.json`:
  - `metrics.json`:
  - `summary.json`:
  - `notes.md`:
- Headed validation observed (`yes`/`no`):
- Key metric changes (for example `maeRgb`, `diffPixels`, `nonBlackRatio`):

## Next step

- Single next action:
- Success condition for next action:
- Stop-rule check:
  - Failed cycle count for this scenario:
  - Minutes elapsed without meaningful metric improvement:
