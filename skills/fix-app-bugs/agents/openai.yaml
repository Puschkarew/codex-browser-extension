  default_prompt: >
    Use $fix-app-bugs with strict evidence mode. Start with guarded bootstrap and
    re-run it with --actual-app-url before declaring instrumentation mode. Always
    print checks.appUrl.configAppUrl and checks.appUrl.actualAppUrl together. If
    bootstrap is unavailable or fails, switch to terminal-probe mode explicitly and
    do not use browser-side fetch(debugEndpoint). Before code changes, provide at
    least two hypotheses in Hypothesis -> Evidence -> Verdict format. For render
    bugs, validate fullscreen geometry and UV mapping together plus viewport/canvas
    and clear/blend/alpha state, and require at least one headed validation step.
    For visual tasks, you may start with scripts/visual_debug_start.py to run guarded
    bootstrap and print next commands. Stop parity tuning after 3 failed cycles or
    90 minutes without meaningful metric improvement, then move to rollback/retro plan.
    For parity-sensitive tasks, include compare-reference artifact paths for
    runtime.json, metrics.json, summary.json, and notes.md. Apply the smallest patch, validate
    the same user-visible symptom, run guarded cleanup, and finish with Root Cause,
    Patch, Validation, Instrumentation Status, and Residual Risk.
